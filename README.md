WIM: A PowerShell download script for Windows ISOs and UEFI Shell
==================================================================

# How to use?
PS C:\Projects\WIM> WIM.ps1 

```

Additional Notes
----------------

Because of its intended usage with Rufus, this script is not designed to cover every possible retail ISO downloads.
Instead we mostly chose the ones that the general public is likely to request. For instance, we currently have no plan
to add support for LTSB/LTSC Windows 10 ISOs downloads.

If you are interested in such downloads, then you are kindly invited to visit the relevant download pages from Microsoft
such as [this one](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) for LTSC versions.
